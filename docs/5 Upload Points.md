The Qdrant API supports two ways of creating batches: record-oriented and column-oriented. Internally, these options are equivalent and only provided for convenience.

Create points with batch:

```python
client.upsert(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    points=models.Batch(
        ids=[1, 2, 3],
        payloads=[
            {"color": "red"},
            {"color": "green"},
            {"color": "blue"},
        ],
        vectors=[
            [0.9, 0.1, 0.1],
            [0.1, 0.9, 0.1],
            [0.1, 0.1, 0.9],
        ],
    ),
)
```

or record-oriented equivalent:

```python
client.upsert(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    points=[
        models.PointStruct(
            id=1,
            payload={
                "color": "red",
            },
            vector=[0.9, 0.1, 0.1],
        ),
        models.PointStruct(
            id=2,
            payload={
                "color": "green",
            },
            vector=[0.1, 0.9, 0.1],
        ),
        models.PointStruct(
            id=3,
            payload={
                "color": "blue",
            },
            vector=[0.1, 0.1, 0.9],
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Python Client Optimizations
The Python client has additional features for loading points, which include:
- Parallelization
- A retry mechanism
- Lazy batching support

For example, you can read your data directly from hard drives, to avoid storing all data in RAM. You can use these features with the `upload_collection` and `upload_points` methods. Similar to the basic upsert API, these methods support both record-oriented and column-oriented formats.

Column-oriented format:

```python
client.upload_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    ids=[1, 2],
    payload=[
        {"color": "red"},
        {"color": "green"},
    ],
    vectors=[
        [0.9, 0.1, 0.1],
        [0.1, 0.9, 0.1],
    ],
    parallel=4,
    max_retries=3,
)
```

If `ids` are not provided, Qdrant Client will generate them automatically as random UUIDs.

Record-oriented format:

```python
client.upload_points(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    points=[
        models.PointStruct(
            id=1,
            payload={
                "color": "red",
            },
            vector=[0.9, 0.1, 0.1],
        ),
        models.PointStruct(
            id=2,
            payload={
                "color": "green",
            },
            vector=[0.1, 0.9, 0.1],
        ),
    ],
    parallel=4,
    max_retries=3,
)
```
